This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive visualization and analysis of various indicators related to state fragility, likely derived from the Fragile States Index (FSI) or a similar dataset. It aims to help users understand the interconnections between different factors contributing to state stability or fragility.
Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is comprised of two main pages, each focusing on different aspects of state fragility:
Page 1: Economy, Human Rights & State Legitimacy
This page explores the relationship between economic factors, human rights, and state legitimacy.
 * Key Visualizations:
   * Sum of E3: Human Flight and Brain Drain by E1: Economy and E2: Economic Inequality: This chart likely shows how human flight and brain drain correlate with the overall economy and economic inequality. The "Increase," "Decrease," and "Total" categories suggest an analysis of changes or contributions over time or by other dimensions.
   * Key Influencers - When is P1: State Legitimacy more likely to be High?: This powerful AI visualization identifies the key factors and segments that contribute to a high score in State Legitimacy. The segments (9.34, 0.71, 0.26) likely represent different profiles or groups within the data that influence state legitimacy.
   * Sum of C4: Security (or similar): This card displays the aggregate value of a security-related indicator, providing a high-level summary.
   * Country List with Values: A list of countries with associated numerical values, possibly representing an overall fragility score or a specific indicator's value for each country. Countries like Somalia, Congo Democratic Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Iraq, Sudan, Chad, Haiti, and Zimbabwe are visible, suggesting a focus on regions experiencing fragility.
Page 2: Security, Demographics & Governance
This page delves into security apparatus, demographic pressures, refugee situations, and aspects of public services and elite fragmentation.
 * Key Visualizations:
   * Sum of C3: Group Grievance by C1: Security Apparatus: This chart illustrates the relationship between group grievances and the strength or presence of the security apparatus.
   * Sum of S2: Refugees and IDPs and Sum of Year by S1: Demographic Pressures: This visualization examines the interplay between refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) numbers, year, and demographic pressures, suggesting a time-series analysis of these factors.
   * Sum of E1: Economy: A card displaying the total economic value, similar to the security card on Page 1.
   * P2: Public Services Count of Rank: This table likely shows the distribution or ranking of countries based on their public services, indicating the number of countries at different levels of service provision.
   * Country and C2: Factionalized Elites: This visualization likely maps or displays the "Factionalized Elites" score for different countries, potentially showing a distribution or correlation across various countries. The small circles with numbers might represent ranges or specific values.
Data Sources and Transformation
The dashboard uses a dataset with the following columns:
 * Country: Name of the country.
 * Year: The year of the data observation.
 * Rank: A ranking possibly related to overall fragility or a specific indicator.
 * Total: A general total, context-dependent on the visualization.
 * C1: Security Apparatus: Indicator related to the effectiveness and control of the state's security forces.
 * C2: Factionalized Elites: Indicator related to internal divisions and conflicts among ruling elites.
 * C3: Group Grievance: Indicator related to social tensions and divisions among different groups.
 * E1: Economy: General economic performance.
 * E2: Economic Inequality: Disparities in wealth and income distribution.
 * E3: Human Flight and Brain Drain: Emigration of skilled individuals and capital.
 * P1: State Legitimacy: Public trust and confidence in state institutions.
 * P2: Public Services: Provision of essential services by the state.
 * P3: Human Rights: Respect for human rights and rule of law.
 * S1: Demographic Pressures: Pressures on resources and services due to population changes.
 * S2: Refugees and IDPs: Number of refugees and internally displaced persons.
 * X1: External Intervention: External involvement in a country's internal affairs.
